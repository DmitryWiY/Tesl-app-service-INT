To run a server do: 
npm run start
 
(Server will be opened on port 5000);

In public/javascript/main.js you will fine different mocked data objetcs (depends on type of request)
(Just change the name of object that u want to send to backend)

Node js:

index.js - connect app with babel (allow es6);

app.js the app itself ;
www.js - creates a server;

/routes - defines and handles routes  
/routes/batch  contains the handles for GET/POST/PATCH requests  (did not have enought time to finish all)
